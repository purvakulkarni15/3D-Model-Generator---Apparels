### Hardware Components

The hardware system includes a rapid digitization station that comprises 
1. a transparent conveyor belt 105, 
2. a dc motor 110, 
3. at least two pairs of dual cameras 115a, 115b and 125a, 125b, 
4. a master microprocessor 120, 
5. a secondary microprocessor 130, 
6. a scanning region 135, 
7. an opposed pair of sensor module 140 and 150, 
8. a plurality of proximity sensors 145 and 155, 
9. a waiting region 160, 
10.a platform 165, and,
11.a visual communication device 170.

### Hardware Setup
1. The conveyor belt rotates either in a clockwise or in an anticlockwise direction along the length of system 100. 
2. The dc motor 110 controls movement of transparent conveyor belt 105. 
3. The pair of dual cameras 115a and 115b and  125a and 125b are connected with one another to acquire synchronized images of the clothing article. 
4. Further, the dual set of cameras 115a and 115b and 125a and 125b are positioned at a first predetermined location with respect to the scanning region 135 to perceive the   stereographic top and bottom visions of the clothing article placed upon the scanning region 135. 
5. Additionally, the pair of dual cameras are connected with a master microprocessor 120 for communicating and processing their respective captured data sets. 
6. The scanning region 135 is a region where clothes are scanned through two pair of dual cameras 115a, 115b and 125a, 125b. 
7. The master microprocessor 120 and secondary microprocessor 130 communicate with each other via Wi-Fi signals. 
8. The sensor modules 140 and 150 are positioned in a parallel opposite position with respect to the transparent conveyor belt 105. 
9. The opposed pair of sensor modules 140 and 150 embraces a plurality of proximity sensors 145 and 155, that are used to sense the location of placed clothing articles and update the master microprocessor 120 with the current position thereof. 
10. The waiting region 160 holds the clothing articles that are queued for being scanned. 
11. The system 100 rests on platform 165. 
12. However, the system 100 is capable to withstand on any ground surface. 
13. The visual communication device 170 communicates with system 100 using Wi-Fi signals.
